# いか's ad block filter

This filter is for adding back stuff that got blocked but breaks downloading / viewing of videos on animepahe.com or new ads that take a few days to get blocked. To add this list or any of the recommended lists hit [Subscribe]. It should open a page that shows the contents of the list with a button in the top right of the screen that says subscribe. After hitting the button in the top right the filter will get added to your ad blocking extension and will auto-update 

This filter is ment to be used with [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin) ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) / [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/))

### Animepahe.com site info

~~pahe.win was used for bookmarking a show on the site. It has since been taken down and no longer works. If you use the [MAL-Sync extension](https://malsync.moe/) there is this [github issue](https://github.com/MALSync/MALSync/issues/840) explaining it. In the linked github issue of mal-sync one of the devs posted a userscript for [greasemonkey](https://greasyfork.org/en/help/installing-user-scripts) [here](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/432078-animepahe-bookmark-url-fixer/code)~~ This is no longer relevant.
